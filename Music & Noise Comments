Since our thing is only going to be one level, I figured we’ll need at least two songs. 
I thought dubstep would work since our game is science fiction themed with cyborgs/aliens/etc 
and since SR4's K12 FM station gave me a weird appreciation of dubstep. 
I used BenSound since his stuff is repetitive (like game song need to be so they’re easy to loop in background) and free. 
Extreme Action is song for boss fight at the end.
I debated between 3 songs for the rest of the level beforehand.
I ultimately choose the song called Moose, but the song just called dubstep might work well, too.
I liked sc-fy (since it reminds me of track from Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, just can't think of the exact name)
but that sounded too serious. I figure our game is more light-hearted and action based so it wouldn't fit. 
Not sure what other sounds we should have. I ripped a heavy grunt noise from free sound for when the player takes damage. 
Another user called JarAxe has some good alien chatter noises that might work for certain enemies. 
Will have to discuss with you what noises work for what enemies in what states.
